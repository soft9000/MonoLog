# MonoLog
From other devices & files to websites & clouds, genuinely need to be able to log to several.

Also prefer to do so via a binary executable.

Adding configurable logging, therefore, my choices were either to (1) update the EzLog proper, or to (2) simply re-write EzLog using C#. 

The later was faster. Also allows using Mono for any GUI if, as well as when.
